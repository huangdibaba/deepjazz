Problem in transplantation:
After try to transplant this project to my pc.
I find that the code of this project have to run on python 2 but not python 3.5 for some packages in python 3.5 is not suit some "import".

Examples:
1."izip_lonest" vs "zip_longest"
If you run the file generator.py on python 3.5 directly,
you will not miss the error caused by code "from itertools import groupby, izip_longest".
Beacuse in python 3.5, izip_longest is no longer exist,you can replaced it to zip_longest to solve this problem.
2."xrange" vs "range"
And another possible bug is in the places where "xrange" exists.
Maybe in python 2,you can use "xrange" other than "range" for less mem use.
But in python 3, "xrange" is no longer exists either.
You just simply use "range" to code your file in the places you want to use "xrange".

Tip:
So,there is a tip if you want to duplicate deepjazz,it is better for you to run it on python2.:)
